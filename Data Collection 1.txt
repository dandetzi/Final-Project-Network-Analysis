How do competing policy entrepreneurs within the US decision-making process cause variation in the outcomes of counterinsurgency campaigns, if at all? 


Main arguments (theories/hypotheses): Competing policy networks within the US civil-military structure vie for influence 
within the defense decision-making process during counterinsurgency campaigns. The organizations or individuals (positions) 
that win influence will alternate during each decision-making iteration, thus creating a variation in counterinsurgency outcomes.

Hypothesis: Informal networks constructed by policy entrepreneurs inside the US interagency will result in competing counterinsurgency strategies 
within the formal decision-making structure. 

For this iteration I would like to operationalize/measure 'competing policy networks' using twitter data. My idea is to map the informal networks associated
with two main organizations: The Department of Defense and the Department of State. When a significant event occurs that forces a strategic decision, policy 
entrepreneurs (or strategy entrepreneurs, as I'll call them), will highlight themselves by retweeting their the messages promoted by their department heads.
So, I'm theorizing here that the real entrepreneurs are political appointees, one or two levels down from the principal decision-makers. These are the ones
who will be the most active on Twitter once a decision on strategy is required.

There are two Twitter data streams I'd be looking for here: Within government tweets, and media tweets. Both would be retweeted by the entrepreneurs, with 
the later being a QT and the former a simple RT. Additionally, if DOD and State are in agreement, I would expect them to retweet eachother's messages on the
strategy.

In the end, I'm looking for entrepreneurs to be the prevelant retweeters, equating to 'influencers' in the standard parlance.
