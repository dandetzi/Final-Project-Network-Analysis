1. To recreate this project, you will first need to apply for a Twitter developer account to have access to Twitter API. This is accomplished by going to the developer website: https://developer.twitter.com Follow the instruction on how to sign up for an account. You will need to provide justification for applying for the account, to include how you plan to use and present the collected data. To be able to retreive historical data, apply for the Academic Twitter account via the same website. The information required for this application is more detailed, to include the description of your academic research and how you plan to present your findings. 
2. Once you receive an account, follow the directions with regards to the key, secret key, and bearer token; these will be needed in R for both the twitteR and academictwitteR packages.
3. This package gathers Twitter data from 12 specific users within the national security arena. These users are all government officials and only the individuals with an official twitter account were used. The excel spreadsheet needed for replication is located in the Data directory in this repository.
4. Coding for replication is included in the directory labeled 'Code'.
